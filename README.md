# LPAIV-HA-dataset-2022
Scripts to analyse the dataset from Funk et al. 2022 

These scripts are meant to be used with a sorted dataset like the one provided alongside the article. Data has to be sorted by subtype as well as splitting variable (region and species in this case).

For all scripts the first command line argument provided needs to be the folder containing the data, ie the subfolders split by region and species.
